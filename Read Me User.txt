Welcome to the beta version of Ellie.

The basic idea behind this is to segregate the offline mode and online mode. 

Start by opening home.html

Offline Mode:
1) Here You can talk to ellie
2) Only a handful of commands work at this point. More will be added later
	2.1) You can greet Hi/hello and also bye.
	2.2) Ask her name, age, gender. "How old are you"/"Who are you"/"Whats your name"/"Tell me your gender" etc
	2.3) "How was your day"
	2.4) "Recommend me a song" / "Whats your fav movie"
	2.5) Ask her to perform basic calculations. Like "Calculate 2+2" or "Whats 3+4/2*5"

To go in online mode, just say "Hey, take me online"/"Lets go online" etc

Online Mode:
1) Here, you can basically browse the web all in one place.
2) Here are couple of things you can do:
	2.1) Perform basic search. "Search for Eminem"
	2.2) Play video. "Video of cats" / "Play stairway to heaven" etc
	2.3) Search images. "Images of dogs" / "pics of white flower at night" etc
	2.4) Search on Wiki. "Info about pizza" / "Information of Salman Khan"
	2.5) Locate a place. "Locate Statue of liberty" / "Show me map of kharghar" etc
	2.6) "News about India"/"News of world"/"News of pizza"

To go back to offline mode. just type "exit"


PS. All the delays are intentional to create the idea that ellie is thinking before replying.

Also if these commands dont work or there are some issues then ping me about it.
Also give me suggestions about what all can I add to it.
